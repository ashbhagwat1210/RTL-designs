This project implements a basic AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) slave using Verilog HDL, intended to interface with a simple register-based peripheral. The primary objective of this design was to develop a clear and practical understanding of how the APB protocol operates at the RTL level, rather than focusing only on waveform matching or functional simulation. The implementation follows the standard APB transaction structure and is fully synthesizable.

The APB slave operates according to the three well-defined protocol phases: IDLE, SETUP, and ACCESS. When the slave is not selected (PSEL = 0), it remains inactive and ignores all bus activity. During the SETUP phase (PSEL = 1 and PENABLE = 0), the address and control signals are presented by the master and assumed to be stable. No data transfer occurs in this phase. The actual transfer takes place during the ACCESS phase, which is indicated by both PSEL and PENABLE being asserted.

Read and write transactions are distinguished using the PWRITE signal, as defined by the APB protocol. A write operation occurs when PWRITE = 1, in which case the slave samples the write data (PWDATA) during the ACCESS phase and updates the addressed register. A read operation occurs when PWRITE = 0, during which the slave drives the corresponding read data onto PRDATA so that it can be sampled by the master. In both cases, data transfer is considered valid only during the ACCESS phase.

This design models a fast, register-based peripheral and therefore completes each transfer without inserting wait states. The PREADY signal is asserted immediately, allowing the transaction to finish in a single ACCESS cycle. While no wait states are implemented, the design structure allows for easy extension to support multi-cycle operations by deasserting PREADY when required. Error signaling using PSLVERR is not implemented, keeping the focus on core protocol behavior.

Overall, this project emphasizes protocol correctness, clean RTL structure, and a clear separation of responsibilities across APB phases. It serves as a foundational exercise in bus-based RTL design and provides a solid base for extending the slave with additional features such as wait states, error handling, or migration to more complex bus protocols like AXI-Lite.
